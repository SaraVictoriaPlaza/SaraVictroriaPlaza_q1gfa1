        <p> My name is Sara Victoria C. Plaza. I am an introverted student that only likes fictional men. My pronouns are She/Her although I still simp for fictional men.
            My role model is inumaki, a fictional man. And I love femboys, which are fictional men. I'm a sane pshs student that loves feeding fictional men. I love reading horror stories
            about love stories. I also do love to love myself because assessments stress me out. Anyways with all seriousness, I love comforting people slash helping people. I try to adapt
            in new things which is very hard for me since isolating myself has always been my restort.
